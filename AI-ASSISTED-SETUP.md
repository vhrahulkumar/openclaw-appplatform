# AI-Assisted OpenClaw Setup

This guide enables AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, etc.) to deploy and configure OpenClaw on DigitalOcean App Platform.

## Overview

- Uses [do-app-sandbox](https://pypi.org/project/do-app-sandbox/) SDK for remote execution on app container console
- References [do-app-platform-skills](https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/do-app-platform-skills) for best practices
- Supports two deployment modes: CLI Only and Production with Tailscale

## Prerequisites

Before asking your AI assistant to deploy OpenClaw:

```bash
# 1. Install and configure doctl
brew install doctl
doctl auth init

# 2. Install do-app-sandbox
pip install do-app-sandbox
# or with uv:
uv pip install do-app-sandbox

# 3. Clone app-platform-skills (if not available)
git clone https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/do-app-platform-skills ~/.claude/skills/do-app-platform-skills
```

## CLI Only - The Basics ($5/mo)

The simplest deployment - gateway with CLI access only via `doctl apps console`.

### Prompt

```
Deploy OpenClaw to DigitalOcean App Platform using the CLI-only configuration.

Use the app spec from https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/openclaw-appplatform with:
- Instance size: basic-xxs (1 CPU, 512MB shared)
- All feature flags disabled (TAILSCALE_ENABLE=false, ENABLE_SPACES=false)
- ENABLE_UI=true (so we can use UI later if needed)

After deployment:
1. Use do-app-sandbox to connect to the container
2. Run: openclaw gateway health --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789
3. Run: openclaw channels status --probe
4. Show me the gateway token from: cat /run/s6/container_environment/OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN

Reference the do-app-platform-skills for deployment best practices.
```

### Verification

```bash
# Connect to console
doctl apps console <app-id> openclaw

# In console, verify:
openclaw gateway health --url ws://127.0.0.1:18789
openclaw channels status --probe
```

## Production with Tailscale ($12/mo + Tailscale)

Private network access - most secure for production use.

### Prompt

```
Upgrade my OpenClaw deployment to use Tailscale for private access.

Update the app configuration:
- Instance size: basic-s (1 CPU, 2GB shared)
- Set TAILSCALE_ENABLE=true
- Add TS_AUTHKEY (I'll provide it)
- Set STABLE_HOSTNAME=openclaw

After deployment:
1. Verify Tailscale is connected
2. Show me the Tailscale hostname
3. Verify I can access via https://openclaw.<my-tailnet>.ts.net

Reference do-app-platform-skills for Tailscale integration.
```

### Getting Tailscale Auth Key

1. Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
2. Generate new auth key (reusable recommended for App Platform)

### Verification

```bash
# In console
tailscale status

# Access via browser
https://openclaw.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
```

## Adding Persistence

Add DO Spaces backup to preserve data across restarts.

### Prompt

```
Add persistence to my OpenClaw deployment using DO Spaces.

I have a Spaces bucket ready:
- Bucket: <bucket-name>
- Endpoint: <region>.digitaloceanspaces.com
- Access Key: <key>
- Secret Key: <secret>

Update the configuration:
- Set ENABLE_SPACES=true
- Add all the Spaces environment variables
- Add RESTIC_PASSWORD for backup encryption

After deployment:
1. Verify backup service is running
2. Confirm data will persist across restarts

Use do-app-platform-skills for Spaces configuration.
```

## Channel Setup: WhatsApp

Setting up WhatsApp requires scanning a QR code, which is challenging for AI assistants.

### The Challenge

- The `openclaw channels login` command displays a QR code and waits for scanning
- This blocks the terminal, preventing the AI from getting a prompt back
- The QR code needs to be visible for the user to scan

### AI Solution: pexpect + File Streaming

The AI assistant can use this approach:

1. Use `pexpect` to spawn the doctl console session
2. Stream all output to a local file
3. Ask the user to open the file and scan the QR code
4. Monitor for "linked" confirmation
5. Restart the service and verify

### Prompt for WhatsApp Setup

```
Help me connect WhatsApp to my OpenClaw deployment.

Use the do-app-sandbox SDK with pexpect to:
1. Connect to my OpenClaw container (app-id: <app-id>)
2. First logout any existing session: openclaw channels logout --channel whatsapp
3. Restart openclaw: /command/s6-svc -r /run/service/openclaw
4. Run the login command and stream output to a local file so I can see the QR code
5. Tell me to open the file and scan the QR code with my WhatsApp
6. Wait for "linked" confirmation
7. Restart openclaw service
8. Verify connection: openclaw channels status --probe
9. Send me a test message to verify everything works

My phone nuopenclawer is: <your-phone>

Reference the CHEATSHEET.md for the correct commands.
```

### Example Implementation (for AI reference)

```python
import pexpect
import time

OUTPUT_FILE = "/path/to/qr-output.txt"

# Spawn console session
child = pexpect.spawn(
    'doctl', ['apps', 'console', '<app-id>', 'openclaw'],
    encoding='utf-8',
    timeout=180
)

# Log output to file
logfile = open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w')
child.logfile_read = logfile

# Wait for prompt
child.expect(r'[@#\$] ', timeout=30)

# Run login command
child.sendline('openclaw channels login --channel whatsapp')

print(f"QR code being written to: {OUTPUT_FILE}")
print("Open this file to scan the QR code!")

# Wait for linked confirmation
child.expect(['linked', 'Linked'], timeout=180)
print("WhatsApp linked successfully!")

logfile.close()
child.close()
```

### Verification Steps

```bash
# Check channel status
openclaw channels status --probe
# Should show: WhatsApp default: enabled, configured, linked, running, connected

# Send test message
openclaw message send --channel whatsapp --target "+1234567890" --message "Hello from OpenClaw!"

# Check for reply in logs
tail -f /data/.openclaw/logs/gateway.log
```
